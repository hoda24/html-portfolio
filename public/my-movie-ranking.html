<h1> Hoda's Few Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies.</h2>
<Hr />

   <h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p> It's one of my top favorite movies because lions happen to be my favorite wild animals. Also the story is great, funny, and sad. Which is a great representaion of real life really. </p>
<h3> Tangeld</h3>
<p> I love this movie because it was the first movie I watched in America. </p>
<h3> One Piece</h3>
<p> One Piece is not a movie but an anime, but it's still my favorite anime of all time. I've watched it since my childhood so it's quite nostalgic.</p>
